This design was inspired by food menus to make the schedule 
visually appetizing and engaging. I used a dark background to 
emphasize the color-coded subjects, ensuring each one stands out clearly.
Rounded corners and hover effects were added to enhance interactivity,
while consistent padding and alignment keep the layout clean and organized.
The Alan Sans font ties everything together with a modern and polished
look that complements the overall design.
